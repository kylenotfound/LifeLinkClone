"Extra hard Monsters" Is a Minecraft 1.16+ plugin that makes the game more difficult by giving the monsters in the game better armor, more health, potion buffs and more.
This is my first "real" try at a Minecraft plugin on my own. 
I would love some suggestions for things I can do to make the monsters more difficult or the game harder as a whole.
